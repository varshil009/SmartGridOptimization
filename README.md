# SmartGridOptimization

This repository contains a project focused on optimizing smart grid operations through load forecasting and anomaly detection. The goal is to enhance the efficiency and reliability of electrical grids by predicting energy demand and identifying irregular patterns in consumption, which can indicate potential issues or inefficiencies.
Features
Load Forecasting: Utilizes historical data and machine learning algorithms to predict future energy demand, enabling better resource allocation and management.
Anomaly Detection: Implements techniques to identify unusual consumption patterns that may signify faults or inefficiencies in the grid.
Data Visualization: Provides tools for visualizing load forecasts and detected anomalies, facilitating better decision-making.
Integration with Smart Grid Technologies: Designed to work seamlessly with existing smart grid infrastructures.
